    <h1>EQUINOX</h1>
    <p>
        Equinox is a 2 player card game where players alternate between a light and dark deck
        with shared discard piles. The first player to empty their hand wins.
    </p>
    <h2>COMPONENTS:</h2>
    <p>
        Light Deck (52 cards) <br>
        Dark Deck (52 cards) <br>
        Light discard pile <br>
        Dark discard pile <br>
        Light player hands (7 cards each) <br>
        Dark player hands (7 cards each)
    </p>
    <h2>SETUP:</h2>
    <p>
        Both players draw 7 light cards and 7 dark cards. <br>
        Both players start on the light side. <br>
        Draw one card from each deck for each discard pile</p>
        <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
        <h3>TURN STRUCTURE:</h3>
        <p>Play cards on your current side. <br>
        If one of your played cards is an <br>
        Ace or Face card 
        <span class="card ace hearts text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card jack clubs text-card add-shadow"></span>
        <span class="card queen diamonds text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card king spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        your turn continues, and you flip your hands to begin playing on the opposite deck. (light -> dark, dark -> light) <br>
        Your opponent does not flip decks with you. <br>
        Once your turn is over, their turn begins.
    </p>
    <h3>LIGHT DECK RULES:</h3>
    <p>
        On the light deck, you must match the suit or value of either deck. <br>
        Example discard piles: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card seven spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card five clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Playable cards: <br>
        <span class="card seven hearts text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card six spades text-card add-shadow"></span>
        <span class="card queen clubs text-card add-shadow"></span>
    </p>
    <h4>SPECIAL PLAYS:</h4>
    <p>
        IF your hand matches either of these conditions: <br>
        The played card is identical to the dark discard pile's top card <br>
        Example: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card seven spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card five clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Played hand: <br>
        <span class="card seven spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        OR your hand contains multiple cards all with the same value, with one of which having a playable condition <br>
        Example: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card seven spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card five clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Played hand: <br>
        <span class="card ten clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card ten hearts text-card add-shadow"></span>
        <span class="card ten diamonds text-card add-shadow"></span><br>
        the play is entirely valid, and your opponent will DRAW an amount of cards
        equivalent to the amount of cards you just played.
    </p>
    <h3>DARK DECK RULES:</h3>
    <p>
        On the dark deck, your must match the sum of either card on top of the discard pile. <br>
        You may play as many cards as needed to do so. <br>
        Ace <span class="inverted-card ace clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> count as 1 or 11. <br>
        Face cards <span class="inverted-card jack hearts text-card add-shadow"></span>
        <span class="inverted-card queen diamonds text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="inverted-card king spades text-card add-shadow"></span>
        count as any value 1-10, even while on a discard pile. <br>
        Example: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card seven spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="card five clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Played hand: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card ace hearts text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="inverted-card two hearts text-card add-shadow"></span>
        <span class="inverted-card four diamonds text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Another possible played hand: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card queen clubs text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="inverted-card two hearts text-card add-shadow"></span> <br>
        Another possible played hand: <br>
        <span class="inverted-card two spades text-card add-shadow"></span> <span class="inverted-card three diamonds text-card add-shadow"></span>
    </p>
    <h4>SPECIAL PLAY:</h4>
    <p>

        Example:
