Equinox is a 1v1 dueling card game made almost entirely with base HTML, CSS and JS.
Gameplay instructions are provided within the game.

Peer.js is utilized for online multiplayer without a server.
To use Peer.js, input your ID and create a lobby, afterwards your opponent inputs your ID and is connected automatically. Whoever hits the start game button first is player 1.

IMPORTANT:
The game will not run if it is opened as a standard file through chrome as well as most other browsers.
This is because of the utilization of the HTML fetch() function to segment my HTML code.

TO RUN THE GAME:
